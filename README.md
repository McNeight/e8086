# e8086 - An Intel 8086 emulator written in C#

This is my on going project of implementing an 8086 emulator.  My goals beginning this project are:
	1. A fully functional disassembler
	2. A completely implemented CPU with all 8086 instructions
	3. Be able to boot some version of DOS.  
	4. Design goal is for easy extension into 286/386 and other instruction sets.
	5. Use TDD to drive the project.
